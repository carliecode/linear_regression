**Linear Regression Solutions**


This repository contains two linear regression solutions:


**Project Overview**


This project demonstrates the application of linear regression techniques to predict:


1. Sales based on advertising channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper)
2. Body Mass Index (BMI) based on demographic and lifestyle factors (Country, Age, Weight, Height, Gym attendance, Gender, and Physical Activity Level)


**Dataset**


- Sales Dataset: Contains data on advertising spend across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels and corresponding sales figures.
- BMI Dataset: Contains data on individual characteristics (Country, Age, Weight, Height, Gym attendance, Gender, and Physical Activity Level) and corresponding BMI values.


**Models**


1. Sales Prediction Model:
    - Features: TV, Radio, Newspaper advertising spend
    - Target Variable: Sales
    - Model Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-Squared (R2)
2. BMI Prediction Model:
    - Features: Country, Age, Weight, Height, Gym attendance, Gender, Physical Activity Level
    - Target Variable: BMI
    - Model Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-Squared (R2)
